    <h2 class="">On the road</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Kastor Lieberung (KL) was ambushed and killed on the road to Altdorf.</li>
      <li>KL had in his possession a letter informing him that he had come into a massive inheritance in Bogenhafen.</li>
      <li>KL looked identical to Otto.</li>
      <li>The characters formed a plan to impersonate KL and steal the inheritance.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="">Altdorf</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>As soon as the characters arrived, two strange men started signalling to Otto using secret signs.</li>
      <li>Their attentions were drawn away by a figure in a doorway who gestured them into the building.</li>
      <li>You later found out that this was Adolphus Kuftos (AK), a bounty hunter.</li>
      <li>The characters met Josef the brandy trader who offered to take the characters on his boat.</li>
      <li>When returning to the boat late at night they sensed that they were being shadowed, and when lying in wait to see who was following they saw the two strange men came into sight, and were shot dead by crossbow bolts.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="">Weissbruck</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>On arrival, the characters saw AK waiting for them in the door of an inn. He left immediately.</li>
      <li>He attacked Josef's boat late at night with two hired thugs, and was killed by the PCs</li>
    </ul>
